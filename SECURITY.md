## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please make a ticket on Discord. Due to the potential security risks, we suggest not making a github issue. Depending upon other tickets, it will take up to 5 days to respond. Please provide as many details as possible. **If other third parties are affected, please alert that third party.(Besides for NeoCities)** 
### WHat will happen
We guarantee that the following will happen upon receiving your report.
1) **Escalation** to a trusted member(if appropriate) and/or more questions if very little information is added. 
2) Investigation. This will consist or reproducing the issue on a test site, asking more questions, etc(1-4 days). If we determine the issue is severe enough we will make announcements within the site and/or discord, and potentially limit functionality. We will also escalate the issue to third parties if we deem it credible and severe enough, or not in our control.
3) Solving of issues. Upon successful solving of the issue, the issue shall be published immediately to the main site
4) Resolution. Unfortunately, there is no bug bounty program at this time. We will announce an patch exploit in our Discord server and attempt to revert any functionallities that may have been limited to prevent severe bugs. We will then continue communication as long as necessary before closing the ticket and potentially implementing new internal rules.
